This is project for beginer who wants to learn C language.
Here is a collection of program. Which will help to beginer to makes basic programs in C.
This project contains all the programs which is needed for learning C language , therefore it is very helpful for beginers.
When I Was learning this language , I faced some problems in some program, Then I decided that I will Make a project which will contain all the basic programs so that other beginers can learn easily.
Following are the collection of programs :-
1) Program to print HELLO WORLD.
2) Program to Add two numbers.
3) Program to Add two numbers in which one is of float type.
4) Program for swaping using 3rd variable.
5) Program for swaping without using 3rd variable ( By XOR operator).
6) Program for swaping without using 3rd variable ( By addtion).
7) Program for conversion of temprature from Farinheit to Celcius.
8) Program for calculation of circumference and area of circle by given radius.
9) Program for velocity conversion from km/hr to m/s.
